# cs310-image-blob-detection

Project Overview:

This project is intended to put into practice the learned knowledge on disjoint sets in order to analyze the relationship 
between pixels of an image (in terms of a specific color).  By traversing the the image pixel by pixel and using disjoint 
sets, this software will be able to detect all the blobs of a certain color and show them in an output image.
